# Linux

* [NvSpeed](https://gitlab.com/aspectsidesxyz/nvspeed): A fast, configurable, and good looking Neovim configuration.
* [My Dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/aspectsidesxyz/dotfiles): My Linux dotfiles for the Sway Wayland compositor.

# Web

* [Gemini Site](gemini://gemini.onefractal.tech): My Gemini capsule.

# Selfhosting

* My Home Server: Self hosting my own open source alternatives to popular software.
	* Specs: I honestly have no idea. It's literally an HP Pavilion from 2009 that I pulled out of a cabinet in my house. I think it has like 4 gigs of ram and 16 gigs of storage. Honestly a miracle it's survived this long.
