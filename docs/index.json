[{"content":"Why Vimwiki is the Best Notetaking Sofware What is Vimwiki? It\u0026rsquo;s a bit difficult to explain Vimwiki, but at its core, Vimwiki is a notetaking plugin for Vim that allows you to make your own personal wiki. It\u0026rsquo;s really easy to organize notes and create links between them. You can do so many things with Vimwiki, and Vimwiki has all but replaced Emacs Org Mode for me, as it is now much easier to organize my notes with Vimwiki than just shove all of my Org files in a directory in my home folder. =\u0026gt; https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki Vimwiki Github\nInstallation Vimwiki was made for Vim, and as far as I know, it does not officially support Neovim yet. You can still use it with Neovim, though. To install Vimwiki on Neovim, simply plug \u0026ldquo;vimwiki/vimwiki\u0026rdquo; into your package manager. For example, with Packer, it looks something like this:\nuse {\u0026#39;vimwiki/vimwiki\u0026#39;} However, this installs Vimwiki with its default syntax, which is this weird version of Markdown that I really don\u0026rsquo;t like. So, I put this in my plugins.lua:\nuse { \u0026#39;vimwiki/vimwiki\u0026#39;, config = function() vim.g.vimwiki_list = { { path = \u0026#39;/home/$USER/Documents/vimwiki\u0026#39;, syntax = \u0026#39;markdown\u0026#39;, ext = \u0026#39;.md\u0026#39;, } } end } This changes the syntax for files created using Vimwiki to Markdown syntax, as well as changing the file extensions to .md. It also changes your Vimwiki\u0026rsquo;s location from the default ~/vimwiki to a folder in your Documents directory named Vimwiki. Much better. To finish the installation, restart Neovim.\nUsage Creating Index.md and a new note. In order to open your index.md file, which is sort of like the home page for your Vimwiki, the default keybinding is \u0026lt;leader\u0026gt; ww. This will create an index.wiki file in the specified path, which in our case is Documents/wimwiki. This document will be blank since you haven\u0026rsquo;t put anything in it yet, so lets change that. In order to create a new Vimwiki page, simply type the title of the page, highlight the title, go into normal mode, and press the return key. That converts the selected text into a link and creates a new document with the specified title.\n[Quick Notes](Quick Notes) Press enter again to jump to the newly created document. At this point, you can just write whatever you want in markdown and :w to save.\nTodo Lists Todo lists are incredibly convenient to manage in Vimwiki. Just create a new note named Todo. To create a todo list in your newly created document, put your todo in this syntax.\n* [ ] Write a blog post about Vimwiki. Now every time you press return, a new todo will automatically be created for you. I suggest following the rules for a todo.txt file just because that\u0026rsquo;s what I do, but organize your todos however you like. In order to mark a todo as done, simply hit ctrl-space while in normal mode with your cursor on the todo entry.\nThese are the only two features of Vimwiki that I actually use, so those will be the only ones I\u0026rsquo;m covering in this post, but there is another really cool feature in Vimwiki called diary. Brodie Robertson has a superb video covering this feature on his =\u0026gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsX3SpHiuYw Youtube channel\nFinal Thoughts Vimwiki is a superb note taking sofware, and I\u0026rsquo;m basically using it full-time now for everything from school to todo to blog posts to jotting down quick notes. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this blog post in it right now. It\u0026rsquo;s just so convenient for me, and I suggest you try it out as well.\n","permalink":"https://aspectsides.github.io/posts/vimwiki/","summary":"Why Vimwiki is the Best Notetaking Sofware What is Vimwiki?

Released just about a year ago, Catppuccin has quickly grown to be one of the most popular colorschemes, up there with Gruvbox and Nord, my other two favorite colorschemes that I have used in the past. There are a few things that set Catppuccin apart from the rest, though.\n1. It\u0026rsquo;s colorful. My two favorite colorschemes of all time are Nord and Catppuccin. What gives Catppuccin the edge over Nord in my opinion, though, is that it\u0026rsquo;s very colorful. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s one of Catppuccin\u0026rsquo;s core values; color is better than no color. Or something like that. Nord, on the other hand, is relatively colorless. I absolutely love Nord\u0026rsquo;s background color, but the other colors in the pallete just don\u0026rsquo;t pop out to me as much. After about a year of daily driving a Nord machine, I came to realize; Nord is slightly depressing. It\u0026rsquo;s still a great colorscheme, it just lacks in color. If Catppuccin didn\u0026rsquo;t have as much color as it does, I would use Nord.\n2. A huge selection of ports. Catppuccin has, as far as I know, the most official ports out of any colorscheme other than Dracula and Solarized, coming in at a whopping total of 170 ports. Most of these ports are maintained by the community, but they all follow the same basic color pallete. There are Catppuccin ports for Neovim, Emacs, Polybar, Alacritty, even ST. Any program that you use, there\u0026rsquo;s likely a Catppuccin port for it, found over on the official Catppuccin repository over at =\u0026gt; https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin the Catppuccin GitHub page\n3. Different flavors based on your preferences. Catppuccin has four official flavors, the aptly named Mocha, Macchiato, Frappe, and Latte, ordered from darkest to lightest. Mocha, Macchiato and Frappe are the dark themes, while Frappe is Catppuccin\u0026rsquo;s light theme. I really love Mocha\u0026rsquo;s color pallete, and it\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m using on my system right now. It has a really nice dark blue background, and is contrasty enough to be easy to read but also extremely nice to look at. There are also some community flavors such as Oledpuccin, which is Catppuccin except black for OLED screens. It looks very nice, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have an OLED screen so I will probably never use it.\n4. A large variety of accent colors. To add your own personal pop to Catppuccin, you can choose from one of 14 accent colors, ranging from rosewater to teal to blue to muave to lavender. My favorite accent color is the basic blue, though lavender is extremely nice as well.\n5. A very active community. Unlike other colorschemes, Catppuccin\u0026rsquo;s community is still very much active and is spitting out new ports. It\u0026rsquo;s really easy to contribute to Catppuccin too, all you need to do is make a pull request on their Github.\n","permalink":"https://aspectsides.github.io/posts/catppuccin/","summary":"Catppuccin: My Favorite Colorscheme Catppuccin is a relatively new colorscheme.
