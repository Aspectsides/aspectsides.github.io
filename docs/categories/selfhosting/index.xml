      <description>You need to host your own search engine. Why? Because Google, Microsoft, even DuckDuckGo, who has a weird relationship with Microsoft, are all tracking you. In fact, Google itself has said that it stores more than an exabyte of your data. That&amp;rsquo;s kinda creepy. Even though most of us have nothing to hide from Google (right?), we could all do with a bit more privacy. For just ten minutes of your time, and a payment of pocket change every month, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to host your own search engine, along with a bunch of other stuff which I will cover in future guides.</description>
