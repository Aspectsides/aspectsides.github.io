            You need to host your own search engine. Why? Because Google, Microsoft, even DuckDuckGo, who has a weird relationship with Microsoft, are all tracking you. In fact, Google itself has said that it stores more than an exabyte of your data. That&rsquo;s kinda creepy. Even though most of us have nothing to hide from Google (right?), we could all do with a bit more privacy. For just ten minutes of your time, and a payment of pocket change every month, you&rsquo;ll be able to host your own search engine, along with a bunch of other stuff which I will cover in future guides.

            Yes, I know what you&rsquo;re going to say. A Linux user, with desktop icons on his desktop? Blasphemy! And you&rsquo;re right. It is blasphemy. I still do it, though. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like my desktop looks like this.
That&rsquo;s just wrong. I believe that as long as you put only what you really need on your desktop, it&rsquo;s only slightly blasphemy. This is what my AwesomeWM desktop looks like:

            This is the first article in a three part series in which I discuss how I write math notes with LaTeX and Neovim.
Why I Started Using LaTeX One thing I&rsquo;ve always recognized about myself is that I have terrible handwriting. Problem is, I&rsquo;m a math major. I kinda need to be able to read my lecture notes later so I don&rsquo;t fail the class. That&rsquo;s when I discovered this blog post by Gilles Castel.

            Org Roam; The New best Notetaking Software for the Zettelkasten method Why not Obsidian? or Vimwiki? I have hopped notetaking software more times than I can count. When I first had the need to take notes, I did them in Google Docs and saved them to Google Drive. This was terrible, and I have no idea what by 13 year old self was doing. When I got slightly older and wiser, I discovered Evernote and transitioned over to that.

            Why Vimwiki is the Best Notetaking Sofware What is Vimwiki? It&rsquo;s a bit difficult to explain Vimwiki, but at its core, Vimwiki is a notetaking plugin for Vim that allows you to make your own personal wiki. It&rsquo;s really easy to organize notes and create links between them. You can do so many things with Vimwiki, and Vimwiki has all but replaced Emacs Org Mode for me, as it is now much easier to organize my notes with Vimwiki than just shove all of my Org files in a directory in my home folder.
